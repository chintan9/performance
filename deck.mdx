# Web Performance

---

## Why is web performance important?

*  It makes user unconformable.
*  It makes impact on sales.

<Notes>
that when a mobile site loads slowly, the user experiences the same stress as if they were watching a horror movie.

— In 2016, AliExpress made their site faster by a third and received 10.5% more orders
— Back in 2006, Google tried making the search slower by half-a-second and discovered that users were making 25% fewer requests
— In 2008, Aberdeen Group discovered that slowing a site down by one second decreases the user satisfaction by 16%

and there’re lots of such data – from both old and recent studies (wpostats.com · pwastats.com).

This is why web performance is important.
